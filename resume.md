## Work Experience

#### Consultant, Self-employed --- 12/2-10 -- present
Clients include Dataspora and Revolution Analytics. Lead developer for the RHadoop open source project, including creating the [rmr](https::/github.con/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2), [plyrmr](https::/github.con/RevolutionAnalytics/plyrmr), [quickcheck](https::/github.con/RevolutionAnalytics/quickcheck) and [dplyr-spark](https::/github.con/RevolutionAnalytics/dplyr-spark) packages in addition to several internal projects. rmr has become the de-facto standard for big data analytics in R and has several thousands users. Presented at [strata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW8ISErV_4s)

#### Principal, Rightload --- 5/2010 -- 12/2010
Rightload was an experiment in personal and group information filtering. Addressing the problem of information overload, it leveraged machine learning, web standards and a minimalistic UI to fit nimbly within the workflow of the information professional that uses a feed reader for her or his information needs.

#### Senior Software Engineer, hi5 Networks ---  8/2008 -- 9/2009
Develop scalable custom analytics tools that analyze user behavior in response to different designs and features, which were run several times weekly to inform major and minor feature and design decisions. Develop relevance models, algorithms and applications to improve the user experience --- that is decide what to show when to whom based on data-driven user behavior models. hi5 was a top 20 web site by traffic at that time.

#### Inference engineer, Quantcast --- 1/2008 -- 7/2008
Develop and implement machine learning approaches to analyze web traffic data in very high volumes. Redesigned reach estimation algorithm that determines ranking for 20 million web sites with proven and significant accuracy gains.

#### Staff bioinformatics engineer, Affymetrix --- 5/2002 -- 12/2007
Led small team of sw engineers to design and implement data analysis pipeline for advanced research group. Directly responsible for core algorithms and high performance computing. Took leading or collaborative role in several papers published in high impact journals, including one describing the highest resolution human transcriptome map to date, designing and implementing data analysis methods as needed. Named inventor in two patents. Contributed statistical modules to [APT software](http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/partners_programs/programs/developer/tools/powertools.affx) for high volume customers with.

#### Bioinformaticist, ThermoFinnigan --- 3/2001 -- 5/2002
Developing data analysis algorithms for proteomics. Involved in all stages of development from specs to design to implementation and validation. Tech lead since 7/2001.

#### Lecturer, University of California, Davis --- 10/2000 -- 12/2000
Teach Software Engineering/OOP/C++.

#### Post-graduate researcher, International Computer Science Institute --- 10/1999 -- 9/2000
Research on algorithms for computational biology and machine learning

#### Post-graduate researcher, University of California, Davis --- 10/1998 -- 10/1999
Research on algorithms for computational biology (QTL)
Visiting Scientist, Sandia National Laboratories 7/1998 -- 8/1998
Research on algorithms for computational biology (protein folding, QSAR)
