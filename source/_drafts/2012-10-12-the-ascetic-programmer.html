But as far as the overall ability to express a thought, they’re very similar. Not rambling, having an idea in your head of what you’re trying to say, and then being concise about it. I think that kind of thinking is the overlap between programming and writing prose.<br />Anything expressed just right, whether it’s being really concise or just capturing it—like anything, a really wellput-together sentence or a little doodle, a caricature that looks just like someone but only used four lines, that kind of thing—it’s the same sort of thing.</blockquote><div><span class="fullpost">Coders at Work, Zawinski on prose vs code</span></div></div>
